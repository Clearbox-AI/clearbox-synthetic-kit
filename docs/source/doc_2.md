## Clearbox Synthetic Kit
Clearbox AI's all-in-one solution for generation and evaluation of synthetic tabular and time-series data.

The tool does not address multi-tabular synthetic data generation for the moment. Feel free to contact us if you need to generate multi-tabular data.

In addition to its data generation modules, Clearbox Synthetic Kit includes a high-speed preprocessing module to prepare data for training, as well as an evaluation package designed to assess the informative content and, when necessary, the privacy level of synthetic data.

Dive into the [Wiki](https://clearbox-synthetic-kit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wiki/main.html) section to explore everything about the library! ðŸš€
